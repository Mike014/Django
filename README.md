# Django
This repository contains a collection of projects developed using the Django framework. 

I developed the BackEnd for various experimental web applications using Django, managing the server logic and structure. I implemented Digital Signal Processing (DSP) algorithms and integrated ctcsound (Python/Csound) for advanced sound processing. To facilitate communication between FrontEnd and BackEnd, I created RESTful APIs and optimized system performance to ensure efficiency and responsiveness.

Technologies: Django, Python, DSP, ctcsound, RESTful APIs
- Django Projects: Each project is contained in a separate directory and includes all the necessary files to run the application.
- Documentation: Each project includes detailed documentation on how to set up, run, and contribute to the project.
- Code Examples: Example code to illustrate the main features of Django, such as URL management, views, models, and templates.
  
Included Projects
1.	sinusoid Project: A Django application that generates and visualizes a sinusoidal wave using Matplotlib.
2.  pinknoise_project: A Django application that generates and visualizes a pink noise using Matplotlib, Scipy (fft, ifft).
